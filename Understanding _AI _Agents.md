Aim:- Define AI agents, describe their components, and 
outline steps for designing one.

1) What are AI agents & their significance in solving real
world problems.

AI agents are automated systems capable of making decisions,
performing actions to achieve specific goals and many more.

Their Significance in tackle with real world problems:-

a) Automation:- It automates many repeating tasks such as
customers query, writing lengthy paragraphs, etc.

b) Efficiency:- It reduce errors and improve performance in 
critical tasks.

2) AI agents essential Components:-

a) Data Processing:-
It can collecting, cleaning, and structuring data from 
different sources like web scraper collects data from
different sources for analysis.

b) Decision-Making:- 
It uses algorithms and ML models to perform actions, like
recommendation systems.

c) Execution:- 
It can perform tasks on the basis of decisions.

3) Steps to Design and Implement an AI Agent:-

a) Clear objective, like what tasks the agent will perform.

b) Collects requirements, like data sources, infrastructure
tools & users interactions.

c) Develop the Agent, build components for data processing,
decision making and execution with the help of frameworks or
libraries.

d) Train & Test, like train the algorithms using datasets
tests the performance of the models.

e) Deploy and Monitor, Deploy the application on 
production level and also monitors and checking their
performance.
